Add a visual sitemap to the front end of your site.

== Description ==
Add a visual sitemap to any page on your website. Options available to add icons and choose the colour of the sitemap.

== Installation ==
Upload wp-visual-sitemap folder to your /wp-content/plugins/ directory.

Activate the plugin through the ‘Plugins’ menu in WordPress.

Customise the look and feel of the sitemap by going to Settings > WP Visual Sitemap.

In the page editor choose icon and whether to include the page in the sitemap.

You can override the sitemap\'s CSS by creating a directory named \'wp-visual-sitemap\' in your template  with a stylesheet named wpvs-front-end.css.  It\'s advisable to copy the stylesheet from the plugin\'s CSS directory, then make your changes.

Use the [wp_visual_sitemap] shortcode to display your sitemap!
